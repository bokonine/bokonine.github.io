Came across this great site:  <https://www.nakka-rocketry.net/>

Goes real deep into the theory and math of model rocketry, especially around building DIY rocket motors.   Brought back some good and bad memories of diffeqs from college - but very cool stuff.  

I did figure out something cool.  One key part of the propellent is that the burn rate is very pressure dependent.  And the pressure is dependent on burn rate.  So there is a nasty equation to try and model.

However, one of the parameters (Kn) is not time dependent, but rather can be calculated in terms of millimeters of burn.  Kn can then be used to calculate the pressure inside the burn chamber - again, not over time, but burn "distance".

So, rather than trying to start with a time-based chart, it made sense to base it on delta-changes based on fixed increments of propellent burned.  THEN the time axis can be calculated by feeding the pressure data into the burn rate equation and getting non-linear time points.

Plot them out, and it works :D  If I have screwed up the math, let me know :D
