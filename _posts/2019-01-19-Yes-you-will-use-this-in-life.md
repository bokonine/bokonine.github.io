Taking classes in high school and college, even as much of a science nerd I am, I still inevitably ran into the "why am I even bothering with this class, other than for the required credit", followed by the classic "I'll never use this in real life"

20 years later I discovered:  yes, yes you will.  Every class that I hated going to - Chemistry, for instance - has, at some point come back to haunt me (in a good way, like Casper).  

About two years ago, I decided to get into fish tanks. Now, I'm the kind of geek that can't just throw a goldfish in a bowl and call it a day (although that is how I started).  Nope - I had to, to quote Mark Watney, science the shit out of it.  Well guess what.  Chemistry.  I clearly remember doing buffer solutions in Chem 102 (whatever) and really not caring.  Well - pH is a big deal in dealing with fish tanks, and sometimes, you do actually need to buffer the water (increase its Kh).

More recently, I also decided to do some research into model rocketry.  For the same reasons above, it wasn't good enough for me to buy a little Estes kit.  Nope.  I scienced the shit out of it again.  Two weeks later, I have a Jupyter Notebook, filled with Python equations and graphs modelling the psi and thrust curves of a model rocket engine.  Not because I needed to for a class, but because I wanted to.  And I have the ingredients for my own rocket engines in the basement, ready to start making them.

Moral of the story - Yes.  You WILL use this later in life, if you want to really enjoy it.
